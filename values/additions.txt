, and it's totally awesome!
--at night.
, but it's pitch black.
. There's a blind person in there somewhere, too.
, and nothing happens until you make it happen.
, but it's hard to see anything.
 in the middle of the night.
 in broad daylight.
 until you run out of supplies.
, but there are limited supplies.
, but everything is underwater.
, but everything is on fire.
, and nobody really likes it that much.
, and pretty much everyone's into it.
, and everyone's totally fine with that.
, because there's nothing wrong with that, right?
 in spite of onlookers' disgust.
 to the chagrin of everyone around.
, and it's the most important thing you'll ever do.
, and it's kind of gross.
, and it's horrible.
, and it's the best thing ever.
, and you can't help but watch.
 until everyone dies.
 until the end of the world.
--indefinitely.
--forever.
, but it's really awkward.
, and it's ridiculously addicting!
, and you never want to stop playing!
, but it's riddled with bugs.
. Beautiful.
 in public.
, but it's all a dream.
--in your imagination.
--in your dreams.
 until you reach a level cap.
 to try to make everyone happy.
 to try to make everyone think.
, and it really makes you think.
, and, wait for it... Zerg rush!
, and, wait for it... capitalism!
, and, wait for it... aliens!
, and the music is amazing.
, and, wait for it... zombies!
, and, wait for it... robots!
, and, wait for it... confusion!
--with meta-game mechanics.
, but the controls are really hard to get the hang of.
. The controls are super simple.
, and you can do pretty much whatever you want.
, and it's a giant sandbox world.
, but it's all a big secret.
, and you can't let anyone find out!
, but it's all in your head.
, but there's not really that much to do.
, and there's too much that you're able to do.
--competitively.
, and you have unlimited freedom.
--with multiplayer.
 in order to accomplish some greater goal.
 in order to accomplish some evil goal.
 in order to fulfill some holy prophesy.
 in order to fulfill a prophesy.
 in an epic struggle against fate.
, but some otherworldly force hinders every attempt.
. The goal is to not die.
. The goal is to do it the fastest.
. The goal is to match things.
. The goal is get the lowest score.
. The goal is to get the highest score.
. The goal is to not be noticed.
, in spite of what anyone may say.
, no matter what anyone thinks.
