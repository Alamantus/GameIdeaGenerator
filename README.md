Insanity Jam Game Idea Generator
Version 0.87

Takes a seed and randomly generates a sentence by selecting random words from several word lists and by randomly selecting a sentence structure to place the words into.
This version splits the process into helper functions, which makes it easier to add more sentence structures in the future.
